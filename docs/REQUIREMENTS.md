# Project Requirements: Laravel & FilamentPHP Application

**Project Goal:** To develop a web application using Laravel, FilamentPHP, and MySQL, initially focusing on core functionalities for managing users, products, orders, and user profiles.

**Target Technology Stack:**
* Backend Framework: Laravel
* Admin Panel: FilamentPHP
* Database: MySQL
* Primary Language: PHP

## 1. Authentication Module

**Goal:** To provide secure user registration, login, and password recovery mechanisms.

**Functional Requirements:**

* **1.1. User Registration:**
    * 1.1.1. Users shall be able to register for a new account by providing a unique email address, a strong password, and their name.
    * 1.1.2. The system shall validate that the email address is unique and in a valid format.
    * 1.1.3. Password strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, mix of characters) shall be enforced.
    * 1.1.4. Passwords must be securely hashed before being stored in the database.
    * 1.1.5. Upon successful registration, the user may be automatically logged in or may receive a confirmation email (TBD).
* **1.2. User Login:**
    * 1.2.1. Registered users shall be able to log in using their email address and password.
    * 1.2.2. The system shall authenticate users against the stored credentials.
    * 1.2.3. The system shall provide clear error messages for failed login attempts (e.g., "Invalid credentials").
    * 1.2.4. Upon successful login, the user shall be redirected to an appropriate dashboard or landing page within the Filament admin panel.
    * 1.2.5. Session management shall be implemented to keep users logged in.
* **1.3. Forgot Password:**
    * 1.3.1. Users who have forgotten their password shall be able to request a password reset.
    * 1.3.2. The system shall prompt the user to enter their registered email address.
    * 1.3.3. If the email exists in the system, a unique, time-sensitive password reset link shall be sent to their email.
    * 1.3.4. Clicking the reset link shall allow the user to set a new password.
    * 1.3.5. The new password must meet the defined password strength requirements and be securely stored.
* **1.4. User Logout:**
    * 1.4.1. Logged-in users shall be able to log out of the system.
    * 1.4.2. Upon logout, the user's session shall be invalidated.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **1.NFR.1. Security:** All authentication processes (registration, login, password reset) must be secure, protecting against common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection). Password hashing must use a strong, industry-standard algorithm.
* **1.NFR.2. Usability:** Authentication forms and processes should be clear, user-friendly, and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

    * `sub_total` (Decimal, Not Null)
    * `created_at` (Timestamp)
    * `updated_at` (Timestamp)

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **4.NFR.1. Usability:** Order management interface within Filament should be clear, allowing administrators to quickly understand order details and manage statuses.
* **4.NFR.2. Data Integrity:** Order totals and item subtotals must be calculated accurately. Product prices in `order_items` should reflect the price at the time of purchase.

**Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Basic Modules):**
* Frontend/Customer-facing interface for Browse products and placing orders.
* Payment gateway integration.
* Inventory management linked to orders.
* Notifications (email/SMS) for order status changes.
* Shipping and tax calculation.
* Reporting and analytics dashboard.
* More extensive user profile management for customers if a frontend is built (e.g., address book, public profile view, comprehensive order history accessible by the customer).
* Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for users.
